# Car Game

## Description

The Car Game is a really simple project for Java beginners. 
These are the objectives of this project:

- The user can type one of the following commands:
    - **run**
    - **stop**
    - **help**
    - **exit**

- If the user types **run**, then there are two possible scenarios:
    - **If the car is already running**, the game must tell the user that the car is already running.
    - **If the car is stopped**, the game must start the car and inform the user that the car has started.

- If the user types **stop**, then there are two possible scenarios:
    - **If the car is already stopped**, the game must tell the user that the car is already stopped.
    - **If the car is running**, the game must stop the car and inform the user that the car has been stopped.

- If the user types **help**, the game must display the rules of the game (commands that can be used).

- If the user types **exit**, the game must print a goodbye message and terminate the program.

- If the user types a command that is not listed above, 
the game must display: "Invalid command. Please try again."
